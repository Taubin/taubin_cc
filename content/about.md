This blog is run by a dude named Dusty. My interests and this blog are generally around tech and beer. I’ve worked in IT for over half my life and have a real passion for it.

I created this site as an outlet for my random rants, raves and sometimes a bit of just getting things off my chest. I also use this site in order to save information for later that I tend to need time and again.

So if you’ve happened to stumble upon this site, congrats and I hope you enjoy your time here. If you find something useful, funny or even a little bit amusing, I’m glad. If you don’t, well I’m sorry. I built this site more for me than for anyone else.
