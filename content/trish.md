>
> I'll never forget the times we shared growing up playing in the leaves and snow
>
> Every memory of you is locked in my heart and I'll never let them go
>
> Even the ones I wasn't there for
>
> Like Dusty hitting you in the face with the sorry board
>
> And the time he peed on your head when you wouldn't let him play with you and your friend
>
> Those stories I'll never forget
>
> That time you had a friend coming over and told me and Dusty someone was coming to kill you had me so scared
>
> You grabbed a butcher's knife and said you were going to stab him when he got there
>
> I remember going through my toy box looking for a weapon to use
>
> I was terrified but I was willing to do anything to protect you
>
> Your friend showed up and I was about to faint
>
> You let him in and told us it was just a prank (thank God!)
>
>
> You could always bring a smile to my face no matter what I was going through
>
> If anybody could pick me up it was you
>
> Anytime I needed to laugh you never failed
>
> You were always there for me with a disgusting joke to tell (chin nuts)
>
> You had a way of being incredibly annoying but hilarious at the same time
>
> You could have everybody laughing and wanting to strangle you at the same time
>
> I remember when mom rented you a limousine on the day you turned sixteen, you were so happy that day
>
> It was so nice to see the smile on your face
>
> I was so excited when you got pregnant with my first nephew, I couldn't wait to meet him
>
> As a baby I would carry him around and feed him
>
>
> Months after he was born the first word I heard him say was "shit" and I thought that was so cool
>
> I knew we would be best friends for life because he was a product of you
>
> There were alot of hard times but you stayed strong and always pulled through
>
> You had a goal in mind, nothing could stop you
>
> I was always amazed at your strength
>
>
> Fast forward a few years and there was another child on the way
>
> You gave birth to another boy named Zane (who you lovingly gave the nickname Satan's spawn)
>
> He was one of the coolest dudes I've ever met since day one
>
> The most amazing thing I've ever seen is watching these kids grow
>
> I'm honored to be a part of their every day, teaching them everything I know
>
>
> You took me to my first icp concert and had to lie to Everett to get him to come too
>
> You said pantera was playing to get him to come with you
>
> On the way he saw all the kids with painted faces "Who's opening for them, Kiss?"
>
> When he found out we tricked him, was he pissed
>
> You had to send him to save me from the mosh pits
>
>
> Visiting you in Florida was one of the best times ever
>
> Going to busch gardens and fishing from the pier
>
> Everything we did was so much fun simply because you were there
>
> I'll always remember every Christmas, thanksgiving, and holiday
>
> And the summers camping at Gunn lake
>
> I'll always think of you when I hear 80's rock n roll that's for certain
>
> And I will always think of you when I hear the word "beefcurtain"
>


We love you and miss you Trish. Love always, Dusty
