            &lt;p&gt;From December 28th 2019 11:00 UTC to January 1st 2020 18:20 UTC the International Space Station did a commemorative SSTV broadcast for 3 Russian Cosmonauts that died this year. Those three are &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Leonov&#34;&gt;Alexi Leonov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valery_Bykovsky&#34;&gt;Valery Bykovsky&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_J%C3%A4hn&#34;&gt;Sigmund J√§hn&lt;/a&gt;. I was lucky enough to be able to pull an image from the broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife and I spend our Christmas vacation in Christchurch, New Zealand with my in-laws usually. This provides some great chances for a nice very open view of the skies. They live in a rural area, and don‚Äôt have a lot of interference around. It‚Äôs quite great for star gazing as well as using an SDR to pull images from passing satellites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over Christmas this past season, I spent quite a bit of time with my in-laws. While down there my father in law mentioned he was having issues getting his RTL-SDR dongle to work properly on his new laptop, and asked if I could help. For those not aware, RTL-SDR stands for RTL Software Defined Radio. They have been extremely popular for a long time for not only pulling in analog TV signals, but also tracking planes.&lt;/p&gt;
