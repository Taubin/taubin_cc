I've decided it's time to move on from twitter, with all of their latest bs. You have to be logged in to see anyone, you are limited to viewing 600 tweets, not to mentiona all of the political crap that is going on with the owner. Pesonally I don't care who owns what (for the most part), but some of those actions can be detrimental to others, and that's what has happened here.\nAnti-twitter logo\nI joined twitter in June 2008, and have been pretty active since then. I brought a few friends onto the platform, and even talked my wife into joining in December of 2008. That gives me ~15 years on the platform. Sadly, that time is now over. Will I use Mastodon a lot? Possibly, we'll see.\nFor now, you can interact with me on Mastodon.\nMoving from reddit to lemmy Anti-reddit logo\nReddit is another site that I have used daily (even more than twitter). I currently have nearly 150k karma on the site, and have been using it since September 2008. I used the site daily for all kinds of things, keeping up with the latest local news, the latest amateuro radio goings on, the latest cute animals, technical information, nearly everything.\nUnfortunately, the CEO of reddit, has decided he would like to be just like the CEO of twitter, and start charging excessive amountsddits-api-pricing-results-in-shocking-20-million-a-year-bill-for-apollo/) for api access. This has led to many subreddits to black out in protest.\nNow let me be clear, I (and may others) have no problem paying for content. In fact I was a reddit premium user for years before this happened. There comes a time however, when it is just greed, and that is what happened here. For a single app, it would cost them millions of dollars a year to continue to exist. On top of that many moderators and users require third party apps to asisst in morderating, or even reading the site. However due to the absolute greed of the CEO, a lot of those people cannot moderate, or even interact with reddit.\nDue to all of that, I have removed everything from my reddit account, and no longer interact with the site at all. Instead I have moved over to my own personal Lemmy instance. The nice thing is I can interact with other instances, using my own account on my own server, thanks to federation. The same thing that allows me to chat with other instances on my Matrix server.\nSo if you want to look for me, don't look on reddit, don't look on twitter, intead look for me on Lemmy, on Mastodon or even on Matrix. I'm loving the fediverse so far, and will continue to use it as my main driver for everything social.\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/posts/mastodon/","section":"posts","tags":["Social media","Personal"],"title":"The social media demise"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/ham-radio/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Ham Radio"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/categories/ham-radio/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Ham Radio"},{"body":"ZL2TOY What is that? ZL2TOY is a ham radio callsign. In fact it's not just any callsign, it's my father-in-laws former callsign and my current amateur radio operator callsign. After years of threating to do it, I finally went to a Ham Cram weekend and took the test to become an officially licensed operator. I have been threatening to do it for nearly 2 years now, and finally did it.\nThe ham cram weekend was very intense. It was two days of constant instruction on everything from procedure and laws, to electronics and making antennas. The instructors are all volunteers and did an amazing job of teaching us everything we needed to know to pass the 60 question test. A passing score of 40 out of 60 was needed and out of the 13 of us that took the test (nearly a record number of students for Club 29) all 13 passed!\nMy view for the class\nOn the second day of the class, we had a morning of continuing instruction, which was followed by actually taking the test. We were only allowed a calculator (you cannot use your phone!), a pen and pencil, and the test itself. I was extremely nervous to take the test, as I haven't had any major tests since I was in school. Once the testing was completed, we waited around anxiously for the results while enjoying some pizza provided by Graham one of our instructors.\nWaiting for results\nOnce the results came in and we all learned we had all passed, there was a huge relief and excitement felt by everyone. It was an intense, but great weekend. I would definitely recommend it to anyone in NZ that is looking to get their license. The group that lead the instruction was great before, during and after. I have had members of the club reach out to me to help me get on the air and running.\nAttempting to make contact\nI now have my 'Feng programmed and ready to make contacts. Unfortunately where I live is in a valley and I've not been able to get any contacts yet, however today I'm building a new antenna to put up on a carbon fiber rod to get it higher in the air and attempt more contacts. I'm extremely excited to give it a shot. Hopefully my next update will be me having made many contacts. I look forward to the hobby. So for now, 73 - ZL2TOY\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/posts/zl2toy/","section":"posts","tags":["Ham Radio"],"title":"ZL2TOY"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/coolermaster/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"CoolerMaster"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/categories/coolermaster/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"CoolerMaster"},{"body":"CoolerMaster, a company known and loved by many computer users worldwide has come up with a brand new product called the Pi Case 40. They enthusiastically released this on Kickstarter first, which seems to be more and more common for large companies these days. When I first saw it, I was extremely excited to pick one up. In fact, I was backer number 437 on the project. At first, everything looked amazing. Then reality hit.\nThe campaign started on July 15th 2020 and promised a shipping time of \u0026quot;September 2020\u0026quot;. I can tell you now, it's currently December 11th, and I have yet to recieve any product but more on that later. The updates from the CM started quickly, and were coming out frequently. They were quite positive in the beginning, givng updates to the status of the project, as well as a few stretch goals.\nCampaign Shipping\nThe updates were extremely positive in the beginning. The replies to the updates were also extremely positive. People were extremely excited about the case. A well known company making a case for the Raspberry Pi? Awesome! What's not to like? Well it turns out a lot.\nThe campaign ended on August 20, 2020. CoolerMaster had smashed their goals, and raised €314,082 from 5,468 backers. This was a smashing success for CM. They were extremely excited by what they were able to accomplish and immediately sent an update saying they just needed the surveys and would start shipping. Things were on track! Or so we were told.\nThe first post campaign update CoolerMaster QC\nThe first update post campaign came out on August 27th 2020 and showed CoolerMaster doing QC checks on the cases prior to shipping them out, a video review by a third party, updates on the custom software they are making for the case and of course, a reminder to make sure you paid. They have to get their money before they ship after all. They also provided a new updated shipping schedule.\nSeptember 15h would be the shipping date (give or take) but that's certainly within the timeframe they had given for shipping. Things at this point still looked extremely good with the entire campaign. The case looked awesome, got a great third party review and things were moving as they should.\nOn Septermber 9th, they provided another update. This one stating things are on track for the previous update and time frames, as well as them putting up a shiny new pre-order button. They also stated their engineers were working on the promised 3d printable add-on bases:\nOur main engineer for the project is now working on the CAD drawings of the following alternative bottom panels/add-on designs.\nM.2 (m) NVMe drives support over USB3.0 2.5\u0026quot; drives support over USB3.0 DIN mounting, 1.4\u0026quot; tripod mounting and velcro straps on bottom panel The process officially started on the 1st of September, we scheduled 3 weeks to:\nfind the correct vendor to work with for the M.2-USB3 and SATA-USB3 electronics finalize ID finalize mechanical design (including correct measurement for the electronics, when needed) Finally they stated at that time the surveys would be sent out on Monday, September 7th.\nYay a shiny purple button to give them more money!\nFirst signs of trouble The promised date of September 7th came and went and most people hadn't received their surveys. I wasn't too worried at that time, as these things happen. There are delays in any project and it's just the surveys. On September 10th, Matteo provided an update stating they were changing some items on the surveys to make things more consistent with users that had purchased extras.\nHere is a breakdown of the changes we are applying to the survey:\nimproved shipping and billing information collection improved navigation of the survey for backers with product variant in the reward additional guidelines for the correct survey completion (avoid overloading of CM support team) additional info on how optional add-ons affect the total amount improved add-ons selection section reworked shipping costs calculation reworked SKUs definition for easier fulfillment management with external warehouses It was at this point there was some talk in the comments from backers that were becoming nervous of the timelines. They stated the product would be shipping on the 14th, yet the surveys wouldn't be out until the 12th. That certainly isn't enough time to check all of the surveys and ship the product in time. That said, this is a Kickstarter project, and delays happen.\nLet the lies begin The next update was provided on September 12th 2020, and boy was this a doozy.\nThey started with instructions on how to add items through backerkit, just in case you wanted to send them more money that you had initially. The next part was an explanation about them having issues with the complexities of having multiple power supplies in backerkit (completely backerkits fault according to CM of course).\nThe next part of the update was a bit of a shock to me. They explained that shipping costs were suddenly higher than expected. They stated the free shipping option was only for certain backers, and that people could not switch their pledge as it was too late\nThis of course upset quite a few backers. Being told initially the shipping was included, or at a certain price and was now changed, is not the way to do things. You would think CM would know better. Then they dropped this bombshell:\nCan I get a refund? It is BackerKit's policy not to allow refunds to Kickstarter pledges after the campaign has ended, or preorders after they have been charged and Kickstarter itself does not issue refunds.\nAny uncharged preorders or failed payment pledges on BackerKit, we will cancel at the backer's request, no questions asked.\nLet's just look and see if I can verify that claim. Here is what BackerKit says:\nIf a backer asks for a refund, you can refund only additional purchases made through BackerKit. If the backer wants a refund for their campaign pledge, you must process the refund through your crowdfunding site.\nOkay so it would have to go through Kickstarter instead. I guess that's why they can't provide a refund. Let's see what Kickstarter says:\nTo provide one of your backers with a refund, please follow these steps:\nHead to your Backer Report from the Creator Tools menu Search and click on the individual backer's name Select \u0026quot;Issue a refund\u0026quot; Fill out your personal credit card information (i.e. the card you’re issuing the refund from) Enter the amount for a full or partial refund If you issue a refund within 14 days of your funding deadline, all fees will be refunded.\nSo that was a lie. Kickstarter and Backerkit can both provide refunds. In fact both give easy instructions for doing so. This was just the start of their lies.\nAnother update was posted on September 16, 2020 stating they were still on time for delivery schedule. They even provided a nice new image for proof.\nGood thing they are still on time!\nOn September 18th 2020 they provided an update stating they were \u0026quot;shipping now\u0026quot; and already sent to the fulfillment centers:\nShould be here soon!\nNeedless to say, by this point people were getting restless. There had been many delays up to this point.\nThe next update was provided on September 30th 2020. They stated that pledges could not be refunded (this is the second time they claimed this even though they were proven wrong previously), they then went on to talk about the production itself in an apparent attempt to justify the delays.\nAll the material related to the production of Pi Case 40 has been stocked on September 3rd. The production line went live on September 7th and the order placed included both the units sold during the campaign and a forecasted buffer (allowing to have Pi Case 40 as an add-on in BackerKit. In total 6799 Pi Case 40 were ordered during the campaign and post-campaign activities. So far around 4200pcs out of 6799 have been produced with a steady output of around 250units per day.\nCorona measures in China have affected the daily output of the factory, but there is no impact on the fulfillment schedule. Also, the Chinese Golden week will not impact fulfillment as production is scheduled to end concurrently to the arrival of goods from other 3rd party vendors\nNot sure how any of this has any justification as they stated previously everything was already at the fulfillment centers, but it is what it is. There was also the usual fluff we've come to expect from this campaign. Updates on the github repo set up for the overclocking software. It was in the comments that things got interesting.\nPi Case 40's show up in stores? One of the backers in the comments noticed the Pi Case 40 was already showing as available in HongKong. They posted in the comments asking about it.\nI decided at that point to complain on their facebook page publicly, since all the updates and comments are private on Kickstarter. I found that someone else had already complained about sellers in HK getting the cases prior to backers (which is against Kickstarter's terms of service). This was their shocking reply:\nHello, this event is a group purchase and it is also an agent of Ramboxs to provide additional discounts. So the quantity is limited 🙏🏻\nTo be honest, the nature is different from kickstarter 🙏🏻🙏🏻\n🙏🏻🙏🏻 Can only say that Hong Kong users are blessed this time\nYes, that was their actual reply on Facebook to their backers that made this possible. Can only say that Hong Kong users are blessed at this time. That's the most condescending line I had seen from a company in a long time. Little did I know, it was just going to get worse from here.\nThe lies get worse and the blame game begins A full month went by between that update and the next one. People were becoming livid. Especially since more and more of these cases started popping up in more and more stores for sale, with delivery dates well before anyone had received theirs from Kickstarter.\nOn October 22, a full month past the promised shipment date, CoolerMaster once again graced us with an update on the campaign and boy was this one a doozy. I'll provide snippets below, however the full update can be seen in a screenshot hosted here (this is a 1mb image so it's not posted directly on the blog): https://static.taubin.cc/2020-12-11/Screenshot_2020-12-11_update17_14.jpg\nI'll break down some if it here. First they blame a second Covid lockdown for shipping delays. Those same shipments they had previously stated were completed\nThis, as it happened immediately after the conclusion of the Golden Week celebrations in China, which stopped production and exports from our factory from the 3rd to the 13th of October, did not allow us to resume fulfillment as efficiently as initially planned.\nThey then stated they will update twice a week from here on out. Obviously a month with no communication after previously promising bi-weekly updates, was not okay. But they had promised it again so it's all good right?\nFrom now on we will strive to release at least two updates per week, following a tighter schedule, and keep you all updated on all major and sub-events concerning fulfillment, cargo restrictions, and our plans to keep the schedule intact despite the reduced logistics resources.\nThey then change the shipment date again:\nThe current target date for starting shipping out the individual rewards (from the regional fulfillment centers to our backers) is around the 15th of November. We are committed to promptly communicate to all our backers whether working restrictions in the various regions imposed for COVID19slow the process down further.\nThere was then this update about the cases showing up in various places for sale, with prices that were cheaper and delivery dates that were sooner.\nPi Case 40 available in the Chinese/HongKong retail market? First of all, we want to thank every backer who contacted us directly to inform us of the alleged presence of Pi Case 40 units on the Chinese and Hong Kong market, your promptness has allowed us to investigate the situation directly with the sales team in China.\nPlease be noted:\nWe have several requests from our partner distributors to bring Pi Case 40 to various regions that do not have access to Kickstarter, including the China region, and we are working to meet these requests, but only after all units are shipped out to our backers.\nThere are no existing Pi Case 40 other than those produced (and still in production) for the Kickstarter backers and media. The first units to go out of production ARE ONLY FOR OUR BACKERS.\nOur backers and media partners are the only ones with access to Pi Case 40s.\nWe cannot stop shops and/or distributors from riding the hype for Pi Case 40 by claiming to offer prices below the official MSRP (24,99$, 24,99€, 199HKD, etc..) or not inclusive of trade and export taxes or have stock available to them to sell.\nHence,we strongly encourage any backer to consider only official information from the global and local Cooler Master offices regarding the pricing and availabilityof any of our products.\nUh right, so there's.... something? A lot of words to not say a lot here.\nWho needs GPIO pins anyways? It was also about this time that Tom's Hardware released a review of the Pi Case 40. In that review, they reveal that the GPIO pinout is not standard.\nThe flap which featureImages the GPIO port gets in the way and makes reading the GPIO pinout labels quite difficult and this leads on to another issue. The GPIO breakout on the Pi Case 40 has been switched around.\nThis means the multitude of Raspberry Pi addons that are available will not work with the case. As you can imagine this is an extreme issue for those of us that purchased the Pi Case 40 to use with, well literally anything that uses those ports. This certainly had to be a mistake right? After all they provided access to the pins, and there is a standard layout for a reason.\nThe next update was provided on the 28th of August 2020. This had more of the same fluff that the previous updates had in relation to shipments. They stated they were selecting packaging now for shipments.\nWe are now selecting the boxes and envelopes our fulfillment partner is going to use for dispatching all the goods (51 different packaging types in total) and we are training their workers for the pick\u0026amp;pack process.\nThat's right. All the previous updates that claimed the shipments were happening or ready, were lies. They hadn't even picked packaging for them yet. Nearly every comment at this time, was asking for an update on the GPIO issue. This goes to show how serious this issue is for people that purchased the case.\nNext update came November 1st 2020. This entire update was about orders being locked and things starting to be shipped to the fulfillment centers (you can't make this up).\nOnce the process is finished and the goods are in the fulfillment centers you will receive a mail from our logistics service of choice, EasyShip. The mail will contain the packing slip and the tracking number for your goods, including an overview of the import duties paid in case you need to unlock your goods at customs.\nComments are again filled with people asking for clarification on the GPIO pins. CoolerMaster still has not replied to any of them either in comments or in an update. People are getting more upset.\nNext update is November 6th 2020. This is entirely about shipment updates again. The entire update is below:\nHello Backers! Slowly but steadily the schedule is moving forward, as planned ;)\nToday we are happy to announce that all Raspberry Pi boards and MS110 peripheral sets have been successfully imported at the US, UK, and HK borders and are on their way to the fulfillment centers.\nThe cargo dates for Pi Case 40 and the Power supplies, coming from our factory in China, are still intact (see update #14) and, although shipping costs have been increasing due to the current air-freight restrictions, we confirm that there won't be any additional shipping charges for our backers despite the current situation.\nCooler Master still keeps intact its promise of shipping out everything with DDP and featureImage any additional shipping costs for our backers.\n(Here is an overview of the countries currently facing air-freight restrictions)\nThe target date for starting shipping out the individual rewards (from the regional fulfillment centers to our backers) remains around the 15th of November. We are committed to promptly communicate to all our backers whether working restrictions in the various regions, imposed for COVID19, affect fulfillment.\nThat's the entire update. Nothing about GPIO pins yet again. And yet another shipping date. In the comments they were called out on their \u0026quot;moving forward as planned\u0026quot; update. This was their response:\nFulfillment started in September, as planned.\nThe fulfillment of the campaign includes FINALIZING THE ORDERS, PRODUCING THE ACTUAL GOODS, creating an ad-hoc logistic structure and so on....\nHow can we ship to you a product that still needs to be produced?\nPlease, be patient, it is a long process and it was not easy for either our small team and our workers in China, especially considering that the entire project was run right in the middle of COVID19.\nWe are almost at the finish line, thank you for understanding.\nThat's their emphasis not mine. That's right they are blaming the backers for not understanding how things work, when it was them that had provided conflicting updates and not sticking to their own schedule.\nA GPIO Update... Finally... On November 12, 2020 CoolerMaster finally gave us an update on the GPIO in an update. Sadly it was not what anyone was hoping for.\nAbout GPIO layout on PI Case 40: Pi Case 40 is designed for the On-The-Go Raspberry Pi users searching for a reliable, durable, and compact solution that suits their nomad lifestyle.\nThe focus is on Thermal Performance, Durability, and Portability while keeping full access to the board's connectors.\nPlease note that Pi Case 40 is not meant to be used together with HATS and other accessories that require connection to (or part of) the standard GPIO of the Raspberry Pi 4.\nThis, together with our plans on developing a new top panel with full hats compatibility, has been shared and communicated multiple times.\nAlthough Pi Case 40 maintains all the standard Raspberry Pi 4 GPIO pins, the layout is not the same as on a Raspberry Pi 4.\nThat's right, it's suddenly meant to be nomadic and not compatible with hats. Or cables. Or really anything else. This was never communicated on Kickstarter or their website, or anywhere else for that matter. It wasn't until a review unit was sent out and the reviewers found the non-standard layout that people even knew about it. When questioned, CoolerMaster stayed completely silent about it until it was seemingly too late.\nIn the comments on this update however, someone pointed out that buried in another comment, CoolerMaster had replied about the GPIO pinout. A user had asked\nIs it just me, or is the GPIO diagram wrong in the picture of it? Looks like the two rows are switched. Pin 1 should be on the top row and pin 2 on the bottom one right?\nThis was the official reply from CoolerMaster at that time:\nit is :D the final version of the product will have the correct labeling\nSo they had lied again. This for many was the final straw. The comments are now starting to be filled with comments about doing a charge-back for this project. Something they are well within their rights to do at this point. Between the delays, the lies and changing the product after it was purchased but before it was shipped (the GPIO pinout) it is justified.\nWhen all else fails, blame the backers CoolerMaster once again graced us with their presence on November 26th 2020. This time they provided more updates on the status of things. First they decided to tell us it's our fault these cases are available to non-kickstarters first.\nRegarding the current miscommunication of retail availability, this is a direct result of an error in estimation between our Kickstarter team (Cooler Master’s experimental arm) and our corporate sales channels.\nOur original goal was to raise $9,000—we’ve obliterated that number and have obliterated our projected logistics along with that. Cooler Master is a company that encourages innovation inside and out; so, if a small 7-person team provides concrete plans to run a project like this, we do so with only the immediate resources we have. Our plans were solid for the original goal and an estimate to send out develop a niche project with a low number of units, focusing on creating a base for a potential future product line. However, since overwhelmingly surpassing that, we’ve struggled with fulfilling as quickly as originally planned the sheer quantity we are responsible for. We sincerely apologize for the delays and are working tirelessly to provide a solution.\nThe presence of units currently in the market are available because those channels are long-standing relations that run more efficiently than our small team of Pi enthusiasts—we kicked off this project as separate entities, not yet sure if this was going to be mass-produced. With the validation of this campaign, cogs in our sales channels activated and the process of launching a bona fide product kicked in like clockwork.\nThe timing of our established sales channels proved to be much faster than our Kickstarter team anticipated. Our conventional funnel to get products to market is separate from our process of getting this product to our backers. Though the logistics of this project has been severely disrupted, our immediate concern is this community. We are doing everything we can to get the Pi Case to you as quickly as possible. The good news is that the success of Kickstarter has now given our team much-needed resources to get your product, to you. We’re working alongside our channel to clear up communications and streamline the logistics process.\nSo they backpedaled on saying it wasn't available outside of Kickstarter before products had shipped to us. We'll chalk that up as another lie told by CoolerMaster here. They then gave us an \u0026quot;update\u0026quot; on the GPIO issue.\n####Product Design: Kickstarter \u0026amp; Retail\nThe Kickstarter Pi Case has always been targeted to a nomad audience. The original design is intended for portability and durability, hence support for add-on boards is not the focus of this version; however, we fully intend to evolve this project alongside the community in future iterations. As for each milestone of this campaign we are eager for constructive feedback.\nThey are literally blaming the buyers for \u0026quot;not understanding\u0026quot; that this was meant to be a \u0026quot;nomadic\u0026quot; product. Even though all of their marketing showed it as being used attached to walls, on the backs of monitors, etc. Never once before this, did they mention the word nomad or state this was meant to be a movable product with no actual connections to the GPIO pins. People were furious to say the least. The talk of doing charge-backs started to get louder and louder. It's obvious at this point that CoolerMaster has failed on multiple levels. Multiple people also commented they haven't recieved any updates to their shipping.\nThe next update came through on December 4th 2020. Let's break it down.\nDear Backers,\nAll confirmed orders have been shipped. Backers who have not received a tracking number, please be sure to check your spam folder thoroughly. For those that used multiple accounts for multiple orders, you will receive a single tracking number through email for orders sharing one address. To track your orders, there may be couriers requiring the use of an app. If the app is not accessible to your region, refer to the tracking email from EasyShip; you may also directly contact the courier for further information through EasyShip.\nWith various regions experiencing a surge in COVID cases, note that some orders may be labeled as “waiting for courier” as there is an immense shortage of workers delivering to private residences. Thank you for your understanding.\nThe claim is now that all orders have been shipped. This should be great news!\nThey then go on to talk about Covid related delays (again). That would be possibly viable if anyone had actually received any form of tracking or updates on when things had actually shipped.\nThe update concludes:\nMicrosite Update: The microsite will go live around the end of January. Though our team is working diligently to reach this target date for the microsite, please understand that our main priority is to overcome the current logistics issues. We strongly invite all backers to reach out to the support team before requesting refunds of orders that are still being processed. Those that have forgotten to fill in their shipping information in the post-campaign survey will be able to reschedule a custom delivery via the microsite. Backers will also be able to cancel an unused pledge, and obtain a full refund for unconfirmed orders (not including Kickstarter and Payment Gateway's fees, ~8% of order cost). Credit card cancellations are not recommended as the payment gateway is connected to fulfillment platforms and order processing procedures; cancellations may incur complications for various parties.\nThe Kickstarter team has been relentlessly working toward solutions regarding all of the above stated. We would like to thank you, once again, for your understanding. Being a part of the Kickstarter experience has been humbling; from our backers, to our partners, and the entire community of other innovators, we greatly appreciate this opportunity.\nIt's extremely obvious at this point that multiple people are requesting refunds either through CoolerMaster, Kickstarter or their banks. This particular update came with a flurry of comments (248 as of the time of writing this). Most of them extremely upset about the lies and talking about doing charge-backs. In fact, at this point CoolerMaster replied in the comments:\nI'm sorry what? Automatically flagged as fraudulent? That's not how any of this works. Numerous people commented in reply to that to state they are wrong and should not be threatening backers. This obviously struck a nerve though as we'll see.\nJust run all over consumer rights and lie about them That brings us to the latest update, posted just today. Full image of the update is here, but I'll break this one down too, because it's extremely juicy.\nWe sincerely apologize for communication errors.\nAs many of you have noted in the comments, there are issues and inconsistencies with tracking numbers.\nIt appears that some backers actually received their Pi Case 40 without ever being sent a tracking number. Others are now receiving their tracking numbers, which should have been sent by EasyShip at the end of November.\nAs soon as the comments started coming in, we contacted EasyShip immediately as we were concerned that some deliveries could be made without a person present at the time of acceptance, and the potential need for couriers to contact the recipient when additional information was needed to finalize the delivery or import.\nWe have been made aware of a technical difficulty where tracking numbers were not automatically generated and sent when the shipping labels were created. This may have been due to an overload of requests in the system.\nEasyShip immediately instructed their team to individually resend the tracking numbers for all orders while they worked on implementing a solution.\nWe encourage anyone who has not yet received their tracking number to check for it in the mail folder of the email used to finalize the order and contact us if the tracking has not yet arrived. On the delivery label details our backers can have the confirmation of all the dates regarding the creation of the delivery, label, packaging preparation, pick up, processing and so on.\nThey have once again put the blame on everyone but themselves for the delays in shipping. They also blame their shipment company for not providing shipment updates. Here's the thing though, EasyShip is literally just software, they don't handle the packages at all. It's just a way to print labels and ship things out yourself. So this blame actually lays with CoolerMaster again.\nThey then provide regional updates on shipping which I'll skip as it's completely irrelevant at this point.\nHere comes the first juicy bit:\n####GPIO / HATS Discussion\nAs stated in previous updates, HATS compatibility was not the intent of this product; the intent is to provide a rugged, portable Pi enclosure that features enhanced thermal performance for the Raspberry Pi. The Pi Case 40 literally \u0026quot;kickstarts\u0026quot; a project that will evolve over time, with the input of backers and community, to fuel a tooling investment in a modular design. Although the Pi Case 40, in particular, is not HATS-compatible, we have the feedback needed to explore the investing in future iterations where HATs compatibility can be a focus in future alternative versions (Pi Case 41, Pi Case 42, etc...). If the Pi Case 40 project prioritized HATS compatibility, we would not have the thermal/thermal features we have today; it would be a completely different project. However, the comments are overwhelmingly in favor of a different version of the Pi Case, something we will explore as this project comes to a close. It is also important to emphasize that warranty guidelines do not featureImage issues arising from the use of HATs perpendicularly to the board via adapters, by neither Cooler Master nor Raspberry Pi nor the manufacturer of the HAT(s). Thank you for the valuable feedback we have received so far and for the time you have invested in voicing your thoughts.\nThe thing is, not only did they never mention any of this on their kickstarter or website, they even stated it would be fixed prior to shipping. They are once again blaming the customer for \u0026quot;not understanding\u0026quot;. It even says this on the website\nEasy-access Ports All ports are quickly accessible thanks to a no-interference design. The GPIO ports are rotated 90 degrees and accessible via the side flap in the TPU bumper. A slit in the TPU bumper allows both Display and Camera cables to be routed outside the enclosure\nHave a look yourself: https://web.archive.org/web/20201210071340/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coolermaster.com%2Fcatalog%2Fcases%2Fraspberry-pi%2Fpi-case-40%2F\nIt even lists this under access to IO:\nAccess to I/OSide I/O, GPIO, Display, SD Card, Camera\nNow to trample on consumer rights some more Now here comes the real kicker. This is the final part to their update:\n###REFUNDS:\nWe have been notified by Stripe of some automatically declined chargeback attempts. Again, we would like to remind you that the processing, shipping, and delivery status of each order is available to the payment processing service in order to offer automation of the acceptance/rejection of chargeback requests. Cooler Master invites all backers to follow the guidelines for a proper support/chargeback request in a legal way by using the dedicated platform, currently under development, on our website coolermaster.com and which will be shared via Kickstarter update as soon as it is finalized. We also urge you to be very cautious about committing actions that may be branded as potentially fraudulent.\nWe remind everyone that the fulfillment of the campaign (started August/September), is inclusive of:\nacquisition of materials creation of contracts with production and logistics partners preparation of the assembly line and start of goods production with DFM finalization CE DoC / CE SDoC certification for the product finalization of packaging materials and logistics simulations goods transfer and import in the 3 focus regions setup of guidelines for order management in third party warehouses finalization of courier list and supervision for correct distribution Having done chargebacks for products not received/not being what they claimed to be in the past, this is an outright lie. There is no \u0026quot;automatic decline\u0026quot; of charge-backs. They are investigated by your bank and determined to be valid or not. It's not up to the company to decide and they don't get to just claim something is fraud. It's investigated and they are given a chance to prove it's fraud, however in this case the chances are that happening are pretty much nil.\nNeedless to say this entire thing has turned me off to CoolerMaster. I will never purchase another product from them again, and recommend no one else does either. The trampling on peoples rights, threats and lies are all inexcusable. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll be contacting my bank to do a charge-back.\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/posts/coolermaster-pi-case-40/","section":"posts","tags":["CoolerMaster","Scam","Pi"],"title":"CoolerMaster Pi Case 40"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/pi/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Pi"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/categories/pi/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Pi"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/scam/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Scam"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/categories/scam/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Scam"},{"body":"This blog is run by a dude named Dusty.

There were a few reasons for this, but most of all because it made it incredibly easy to move everything or have everything backed up in case of a catastrophic failure of some sort. After all, my hard drives are quite old and have been running hard out.\nOld drives\nFor a long time, I used NGINX as a reverse proxy. There’s nothing really wrong with that, but I do love to experiment from time to time on new things. One of the things I’ve heard quite a bit about is Traefik. It’s listed on the website as “The Cloud Native Edge Router”. In other words, a reverse-proxy.\nIf you go to their website, you’ll see the usual corporate BS about how great it is, how many companies use it, etc… The one thing that really intrigued me about it, is the simple integration with Docker. I use Docker for almost everything these days (as pointed out above) and being able to have the proxy automatically pick it up and serve everything, taking care of my SSL certs was great. So I started out learning more.\nThe first place I always start out with learning new things, is the official docks, if there are some. Luckily for me, there are: docs.traefik.io I started out there, and read through everything. It had some easy to follow examples and I used them to test everything out. Unfortunately, I ran into some minor issues.\nI use Cloudflare for all of my DNS. There are a couple of reasons, however it being free and quite reliable is near the top of the list. The one small issue with that, is that I also use LetEncrypt for all of my certificates. That’s not really a problem, but can make things a little more difficult. Since I use Cloudflare, getting a wildcard certificate (for example *.taubin.cc) to use for my domain can get a little complex. I have to use a DNS resolver for the certificates instead of just an HTTP resolver.\nI ran into some issues getting things working properly with the wildcart cert, as traefik wasn’t asking cloudflare properly for the certificate. I ended up asking for help on reddit, and getting quite a bit of help with it. I was able to get it functioning in the end, and below is a (somewhat redacted) copy of how I made things work.\nThat’s long I know, and it works (for the most part). The one issue I’ve run into is trying to get it working properly with the ciphersuites.\nA helpful person on reddit suggested I define everything as a command instead of using the toml file. This was an amazing suggestion and has actually made things a bit better. I’m still experimenting, however, this does seem to be working. The only problem I’ve run into so far, is I’ve run afoul of Lets Encrypt’s rate limiting. That will solve itself in time though.\nFor now, below is the (currently being worked on) traefik docker-compose file I’m using. I still have a lot to add, like hardening up the TLS certificate handling, but for now it’s working properly.\nI’ll be updating this post as things progress, but for now, this seems to be a working function of Traefik with Cloudflare and Lets Encrypt wildcard certificates.\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/posts/traefik-all-the-things/","section":"posts","tags":["Traefik","Blog","Server","HomeServer"],"title":"Traefik All the Things"},{"body":"From December 28th 2019 11:00 UTC to January 1st 2020 18:20 UTC the International Space Station did a commemorative SSTV broadcast for 3 Russian Cosmonauts that died this year. Those three are Alexi Leonov, Valery Bykovsky and Sigmund Jähn. I was lucky enough to be able to pull an image from the broadcast.\nMy wife and I spend our Christmas vacation in Christchurch, New Zealand with my in-laws usually. This provides some great chances for a nice very open view of the skies. They live in a rural area, and don’t have a lot of interference around. It’s quite great for star gazing as well as using an SDR to pull images from passing satellites.\nNearest Neighbors\nIt’s quite a bit of fun while down to pull NOAA images as well as watch for the ISS to pass when it’s visible in the sky. This year however, I got quite a treat. I learned that the ISS would be sending SSTV (Slow Scan Television) images. I got quite excited as I had my trusty RTL-SDR dongle with me, and would be in a prime position to pull some images.\nWe pulled out the ISS Tracker app on my phone and took a look at the passes. There was going to be one a number of hours after the event started, though it was a bit low at 57° above the horizon. There are a few trees in the way, but we figured we’d try it and see how it went.\nI pulled out my trusty laptop, dipole antenna and rtl-sdr dongle and set up on a chair. Then the waiting game began.\nThe amazing set up. So professional!\nI held my breath (literally) once the pass got high enough in the sky to possibly bring in a signal. I was a bit nervous as I’ve never pulled a SSTV image before, let alone one from space! I peeked from between fingers to have a look and see if I was getting anything, and I was! I had a very strong signal coming in. Unfortunately in my excitement I forgot to get a screenshot.\nThe ISS sends SSTV images in spurts. They are 3 minutes on, 2 minutes off. I was able to pull 1 and 1/2 images during the pass, and I’m very pleased how they turned out. I received image 3/15 in this pass, which you can see below. This image commemorates Sigmund Jähn and Valey Bykovsky, including images of both.\nISS SSTV Commemorative image broadcast end of 2019\nI am very pleased with the image I was able to get, and the quality is quite good. One of the cool things about getting these images, is you are able to submit them to the ARISS SSTV team to get a reward certificate for participating. I submitted mine right after the pass, and received my certificate in my email quite quickly. I will also be sending in for a QSL card, which I’m very excited about. I’ll update once I send it out and once I get the card back. The certificate for participating is below. I was awarded number 150191.\nARISS SSTV Award\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/posts/ariss-iss-sstv-december-2019/","section":"posts","tags":["ISS","SSTV","RTL-SDR"],"title":"Ariss ISS SSTV December 2019"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/iss/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"ISS"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/categories/iss/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"ISS"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/rtl-sdr/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"RTL-SDR"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/categories/rtl-sdr/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"RTL-SDR"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/sstv/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"SSTV"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/categories/sstv/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"SSTV"},{"body":"For quite a while, our house has used a server to host all of our media as well as some other items. There are a great many advantages to this, as it allows easy control over our movies, TV, music, comics, eBooks etc… Ever since the server was first built (it’s actually my old computer), it has run Windows 10 pro. There is nothing implicitly wrong with this, however Windows can be quite a resource hog. Just having it sit at the desktop, without much else running uses a couple of gigs of ram, as well as a bit of power to push the desktop even though it’s not actually being used.\nI’ve been wanting to change this set up for quite a while, but I’ve not really had the push to do it. One of the reasons is the potential for downtime, which goes against wife approval standards. An easy way to do deal with this, would to be to containerize everything, then move it. But really, how much fun would that be? Things were chugging along happily until one day when the power went out. This is drastic for us, as at the time we didn’t have a way to get into our garage. Upon everything coming back up, a portion of my Windows partition had corrupted itself. Now this can happen to any OS, but it was the push I needed.\nUbuntu to the rescue!\nInstead of recreating everything within Windows, I decided to move everything to one of the most popular linux distros available Ubuntu.\nI’ve been running Ubuntu on all of my web servers for as long as I can remember. It’s pretty easy to learn once you really dive into it, and there is a lot of community support for it. After formatting my main SSD drive in the server, I downloaded the Ubuntu 18.10 Server image torrent. That’s right kids, torrents can be used for good as well as evil!\nAfter Ubuntu server was installed, I got started mounting my drives (more on that later) and installing Docker. Things are about to get technical, so if you aren’t interested, skip past this point section.\nTechnical bits I first had to find the drive partitioning for my drives other than the main drive where Ubuntu was installed. In order to do so, I SSH’d into the server (using just my ssh keys, security kids! no passwords here!), and ran the following to get a mapping of my drives:\nsudo lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT,LABEL\rI love the new Windows Shell!\nThis showed my my currently installed drives, and their drive paths. Here you can see there are 3 drives installed, the 125 gig SSD as the main drive, a 3 TB drive and a 4 TB drive. When I initially did the installation, the 4TB drive was actually in an external NAS enclosure made by WD. It’s quite old and I had difficulty with some of my docker containers using it properly, so I ended up shucking it and installing it directly.\nOnce I knew where the drives were within Ubuntu (SDA and SDB), I was able to make a directory for each, give the directories permission, and map the drives in /etc/environment\nsudo nano /etc/fstab\r## Drive mounts:\r#D drive mount - Red drive - 4 TB\r/dev/sda /media/d ext4 defaults 0 2\r#E drive mount - Old Drive 3 TB\r/dev/sdb /media/e ext4 defaults 0 2\rOnce the drives were mounted and verified, I started the set up of Docker and Docker-Compose. I first ran the usual linux updates (apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apt upgrade -y) then got to the installation.\n# Update\rsudo apt-get update\r# Install certificates for adding the docker key\rsudo apt-get install \\\rapt-transport-https \\\rca-certificates \\\rcurl \\\rgnupg-agent \\\rsoftware-properties-common\r# Install docker key\rcurl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -\r# Add docker repo\rsudo add-apt-repository \\\r\u0026quot;deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \\\r$(lsb_release -cs) \\\rstable\u0026quot;\r# Update apt\rsudo apt-get update\r# Install Docker\rsudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io\r# Download docker-compose\rsudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.24.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\r# Make it executable\rsudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose\r# Add myself to the docker group\rsudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}\r# Set up my environment so I don't need to keep adding the usergroups and timezone\rsudo nano /etc/environment\rPUID=1000\rPGID=999\rTZ=\u0026quot;Pacific/Auckland\u0026quot;\rThat’s it! The technical bits done (for the most part).\nPhoto by Guillaume Bolduc on Unsplash\nOnce the hard part was done, installing Docker, Docker-Compose and setting all the directories and permissions, I was good to go. All I needed to do was put together my docker-compose file and run it.\nThe great thing about Docker is everything is held into little containers. Each of them are separated from each other, so if one breaks, it’s not going to bring down the entire system. This can have it’s many advantages, as well as some disadvantages. Luckily for me, the advantages are greater than the disadvantages.\nOne of the greatest advantages to this system, is being able to keep all of the data used by the containers (TV, Movies, etc…) completely separated from the container, and simply added as a volume. This means if I ever need to replace my main drive, or rebuild the system for whatever reason, I can simply remap my volumes, and run my docker-compose file and be right back where I left off. Another great advantage is this system uses much fewer resources than my windows box did.\nhtop showing the currently used resources\nWith 20 running containers, my server is happily chugging along with 2 gigs of ram in use, and barely any processor usage. Something that would be practically impossible with Windows 10. Even this blog is being run on the server currently (as I write it that is, it’s hosted on a webserver).

In my last post, I wrote about how in-probable it was that the 2019 NZ Budget hack was just due to someone using the search engine on the website. Well I was wrong. I had expected the IT team at the NZ Treasury to have at least a little bit of competence. Sadly the seem to be incredibly incompetent.\nThe hack at the Treasury was in fact due to someone searching for the document, and finding it. I am utterly flabbergasted at how the Treasury department handled everything to do with this. Now this certainly does not absolve National of their handling of everything either, but again I am not political and I’m not going to get into that.\nHopefully this entire thing will be a lesson for not only the Treasury department, but all IT and Web teams everywhere in how not to do things. Sadly, I have a feeling this won’t be the last time we see things like this happen. Especially since the Treasury website runs on a very outdated version of Drupal. There needs to be lessons to management everywhere, to listen to your IT team. Give them the tools and the power to change things that they know are wrong.

You see the 2019 budget for NZ is meant to be released tomorrow (Thursday), but was apparently leaked by the opposition party on Tuesday. This has led to a lot of speculation, name calling, threats, police reports, etc… You know typical politics.\nNow normally I wouldn’t care about this at all, and certainly wouldn’t write about it here. The thing is, anyone that knows me knows I don’t really care for politics. I never discuss it and don’t follow any of the parties. That said I do vote, but not even my wife knows (or cares) who I vote for.\nWhy am I writing about this now and here then? Well it’s because of the amount of misinformation around this subject. There are articles like this one on Stuff NZ that state it was all just a guess that allowed the people that provided the leak to National to download the budget. This simply is not true. Anyone that’s developed websites knows that any time you are linking to a document on a webpage, it is usually not stored on the same server as the webpage. Instead it’s usually stored on a CDN or a file server.\nIf we take a look at said webpage, it simply shows a 403 error. The link provided here is a cached copy of the webpage, as it will certainly change after Thursday’s official release of the budget. Many organizations both large and small, will set up a placeholder page for an item that is going to be released at a soon date. Case in point is this one. The webpage is set up as a placeholder, and a 403 status code is given to it.\nThis allows search engines to start to parse the page prior to it being actually enabled, and also allows a very fast set up of the page once it’s ready for release. I can even give you an example of this right here on this page. If you click the link below, it will take you to a pdf of a leaked budget for my household. That’s right, this wasn’t going to be released until Friday, but I’m giving you a leaked version right here!\nIf you click on THIS LINK it will take you to a leaked version of my budget for 2019.\nA totes legit haxxor Photo by NeONBRAND on Unsplash\nNow let’s break this down like a leet haxxor would. At least the type that are referred to by the likes of Stuff. We can see that the page exists on this web server. It’s linked right there to taubin.cc. So that totally means the super secret page exists! So far so good. There’s even a link there to my super secret budget.\nLet’s have a look at that. If you hover over the link, or even open it you’ll see that the link points to a subdomain of taubin.cc. Strange, why would that be. Using our leet haxxor skillz, we can assume a few things. Either that is a random coincidence, or it’s just to keep things easy and means nothing. Unfortunately, our leet haxxor skillz are wrong. The correct answer is that the file is actually on a completely different server than the one this blog is hosted on. In fact that file happens to be on my CDN (Content Delivery Network). In fact if you look at any of the images on this blog, they are all hosted on my CDN, and not on the same page (or even server) that they appear.\nTaking this as an example, we can see how the Treasury department of New Zealand does things. They have a website set up, most likely on a dedicated server, and host the actual files on another server. This means they can set up a webpage prior to uploading the actual files (in this case PDF files), on their public file server. So you see, it’s entirely possible to have a link to a webpage, with something on that webpage without it actually linking to the budget document.\nThis is precisely what has happened here. They have created the webpage (just like they have for previous years) following the same naming schema as they have in past years (because that’s the way to do things properly), and left the link to the actual document out of it until it’s ready for public publishing.\nSo what has actually happened? Well, we can make a few assumptions based on what we’ve been told. First the National Party stated on Tuesday that they had received a copy of the budget prior to it’s official release on Thursday. The Finance Minister stated he has informed the police that their servers have been hacked after they found evidence of said hacking. This started a whole lot of speculation.\nA user on twitter stated the information was publicly available at the link provided above. He initially stated this information was out in the public view and not actually “hacked”. He was proven incorrect as the webpage only showed the 403 page listed above, with no actual link to the PDF containing the budget. This of course hasn’t stopped the media from taking this and running with it. However as we’ve proven on this post, the PDF would not have been posted directly on the same web server as the web page is.\nAfter all of that happened the leader of the National Party, Simon Bridges, came out and said National had done nothing wrong while accusing the head of the Treasury of smearing his party. The problem with this is that the Treasury is pretty impartial when it comes to politics. They don’t answer to either party. He has since doubled down on this, and stated they aren’t doing anything wrong by possessing the information and releasing it.\nThe problem with this, is that it is in fact illegal. However that again is not the point here. To get back to the known facts:\nThe budget was never posted on the Treasury website The Treasury was in fact hacked Police are investigating Based upon that, there’s a whole lot of misinformation going around right now unfortunately. We won’t know what really happened for quite a while (if ever) but we can see how this misinformation about the PDF of the budget being publicly accessible on the website is simply incorrect. Hopefully this helps clear stuff up from a technical standpoint if nothing else.\nBefore believing everything the media (social and otherwise) tells you, try to look into the way those things work first, and make your own opinion. I’m not here to sway it, I’m simply here to help understand how it works from a technical standpoint.\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2019-nz-budget/","section":"posts","tags":["NZ","New Zealand"],"title":"2019 NZ Budget"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/archives/","section":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/fibre/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Fibre"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/categories/fibre/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Fibre"},{"body":"I realized today that I hadn’t given an update on my fibre saga in quite some time. After going back and forth with BigPipe, I ended up cancelling their service as was shown in a previous post. There were quite a few reasons for this, however the biggest one was them removing IPV6, as well as not being upfront about the issues I was having with the fibre installation. I moved to Voyager after doing quite a bit of searching on geekzone. The service with them has been outstanding so far, with zero issues.\nWhen I transferred to them, my fibre installation order was still not completed. On the plus side, Voyager was much more willing to give me the information they had than BigPipe ever was. They informed me that the reason for the lack of fibre installation, was that Chorus wanted to do my full complex at once instead of doing each apartment individually as they had been doing them. This was a blessing and a curse. A blessing in that I knew the reasoning for the lack of installation, a curse as it meant getting full approval from my body corp. Luckily the body corp was ready for the complex to be completed as quickly as possible, and approved the exterior work in record time!\nI was informed on July 11th, that the process for getting consent from the body corp had actually started. This means between the time of my first query to BigPipe (April 10th) nothing had actually moved forward. At no point in that 3 months, had I been informed by BigPipe that they were unable to do anything, and just kept being pushed around by them with no actual updates. To say I was furious would be an understatement.\nThe actual install date Photo by Ildefonso Polo on Unsplash\nFinally after many many months of waiting, wanting updates, pulling my hair out, and being overall somewhat impatient the day had finally come. The installers were extremely friendly. They walked with me outside of my building and discussed placement with me. They had initially wanted to do the install in my bathroom (?) as that was the closest outside wall. They were being pretty adimant about it, until I explained I have access to our attic space. Well, more like a crawlspace but it could be used. They were happy with that and so was I.\nIt took the installer a few hours to run all of the fibre outside, as well as through my attic. In the end, they ran it down the wall in our office, and to the ONT (Optical Network Terminal). They plugged everything in, and ran their tests. Everything worked amazingly on their end! I was so excited I could have hugged them. I had already set up everything on my Edgerouter Lite and after they left, hooked everything up in order to run my first speedtest.\nSpeed test run from home\nThat’s the fastest internet I’ve ever had at a house I lived in. Ever. I have the ability to get gigabit down and 500 mb/s up, however that would definitely be overkill and wouldn’t actually make much of a difference for most of what I do. We have been running a 100/20 plan since the isntall last July, and it’s worked wonderfully for us. It’s been rock solid and the speeds have never dipped below where they should be. I’ve been extremely pleased with both the connection and Voyager. There are times I’m downloading something and it’s taking a tiny bit longer than I would like, but I can’t quite justify the increase in cost for an increase in speed.\nFor now, my install woes are gone, and my internet is nice and fast. That is until we move. If we ever find a house. But that’s another post for another time.\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/posts/final-fibre-update/","section":"posts","tags":["Fibre","Internet","HomeServer"],"title":"Final Fibre Update"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/internet/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Internet"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/categories/internet/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Internet"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/planes/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Planes"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/categories/planes/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Planes"},{"body":"Tracking some planes 🛩️ using an SDR and homemade antenna Over Christmas this past season, I spent quite a bit of time with my in-laws. While down there my father in law mentioned he was having issues getting his RTL-SDR dongle to work properly on his new laptop, and asked if I could help. For those not aware, RTL-SDR stands for RTL Software Defined Radio. They have been extremely popular for a long time for not only pulling in analog TV signals, but also tracking planes.\nMost planes transmit their signal in near real time, by using the ADS-B Automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast signalling system. This allows not only other planes, but also ground control, ATC and other see where the planes are, what direction and speed they are headed, and a lot of other information. All of these signals are transmitted at 1090mhz. Luckily for us, someone has figured out how to read these signals using a cheap tv dongle.\nBoth my father in law and myself have used these dongles for a couple of years to track planes. He is on limited bandwidth with his internet, however I’m lucky enough to not be so I also transmit this data to various trackers around the world. Unfortunately for my father in law, his tracker was not working properly with his new Acer laptop. We tried a number of times to get it working properly, however the software he was using to receive these images, was not allowing the dongle to power up properly. We have found a solution, but that’s not the point of this post, so I’ll spare you.\nHelping him work out his issues with the laptop and his SDR dongle to track planes (which he does without an internet connection) renewed an interest in me in not only tracking planes, but seeing what else can be done with one of these amazing little dongles. When you purchase most dongles, they come with a basic antenna made for pulling analog tv stations. Because of this, they are not ideal for pulling 1090 signals. You will get some, however there are much better ways.\nI had initially purchased an antenna from Amazon that was supposedly tuned for 1090. I had also purchased a slightly more expensive dongle which included a built in filter to help filter out other signals. Using this I had decent reception and was feeding the data to Flight Radar 24. I knew however, there had to be a better way.\nMy father in law mentioned a coaxial collinear antenna he had seen, and thought it would be fun to build while I was down there. We went to his garage and found the coax we needed, as well as the connectors needed to hook the antenna up to a dongle, and went to work. Well, I’ll be honest, he did all the work. He cut it to proper lengths, trimmed the insulation and pressed the coax into lengths. Once it was all put together, he placed the entire thing in a PVC enclosure, and we plopped it up on his roof to test it out.\nHe is in a nice location with very open skies, and the ability to place his antenna directly at the peak of his roof. Talk about ideal! Once we had the antenna in place, we immediately started to pull in data. He was pulling data from approximately 220 nautical miles away. This is exceptional performance from a home built antenna made out of nothing other than some coax!\nOnce the antenna was tested and verified, he gave it to me to take home, which was super generous of him. He stated he will probably make himself another antenna in the future that can be tossed into the back of his car, and used at the airport nearby. When I finally arrived home, I tacked it up in the best place I have at this time, taped to my window. Using this, I’ve been able to increase my distance as well as number of reported planes by a lot. I now feed to nearly every source I can find, and have been experimenting.\nThe data that gets streamed to the various flight tracking sites, looks like this in it’s json format:\n{ \u0026quot;now\u0026quot; : 1546903703.3,\r\u0026quot;messages\u0026quot; : 266783,\r\u0026quot;aircraft\u0026quot; : [\r{\u0026quot;hex\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;3a65a2\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;category\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;A0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;version\u0026quot;:0,\u0026quot;mlat\u0026quot;:[],\u0026quot;tisb\u0026quot;:[],\u0026quot;messages\u0026quot;:254,\u0026quot;seen\u0026quot;:94.5,\u0026quot;rssi\u0026quot;:-33.9},\r{\u0026quot;hex\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;c8221c\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;flight\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;GBA590 \u0026quot;,\u0026quot;alt_baro\u0026quot;:2325,\u0026quot;alt_geom\u0026quot;:2675,\u0026quot;gs\u0026quot;:154.6,\u0026quot;tas\u0026quot;:166,\u0026quot;track\u0026quot;:216.1,\u0026quot;roll\u0026quot;:1.1,\u0026quot;baro_rate\u0026quot;:-576,\u0026quot;squawk\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;6412\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;category\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;A1\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;nav_qnh\u0026quot;:1019.0,\u0026quot;nav_altitude\u0026quot;:1504,\u0026quot;nav_modes\u0026quot;:[\u0026quot;vnav\u0026quot;],\u0026quot;lat\u0026quot;:-36.837982,\u0026quot;lon\u0026quot;:174.867897,\u0026quot;nic\u0026quot;:6,\u0026quot;rc\u0026quot;:926,\u0026quot;seen_pos\u0026quot;:1.4,\u0026quot;version\u0026quot;:1,\u0026quot;nic_baro\u0026quot;:1,\u0026quot;nac_p\u0026quot;:7,\u0026quot;nac_v\u0026quot;:0,\u0026quot;sil\u0026quot;:3,\u0026quot;sil_type\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;unknown\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;mlat\u0026quot;:[],\u0026quot;tisb\u0026quot;:[],\u0026quot;messages\u0026quot;:1645,\u0026quot;seen\u0026quot;:1.4,\u0026quot;rssi\u0026quot;:-32.9},\r{\u0026quot;hex\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;c817bd\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;category\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;A1\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;version\u0026quot;:2,\u0026quot;sil_type\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;perhour\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;mlat\u0026quot;:[],\u0026quot;tisb\u0026quot;:[],\u0026quot;messages\u0026quot;:746,\u0026quot;seen\u0026quot;:97.3,\u0026quot;rssi\u0026quot;:-35.1}\r]\rLuckily there is an easier way to look at the data using the same platform that creates the data, dump1090. Dump1090-fa (the version I’m using on my pi) creates a really useful website to present the data locally to you. You can see an example of it below, while it tracks an airplane that happened to be passing by.\nI’m also able to pull some stats from my dump1090 client, which is written to an external hard drive in order to save writes to my sd card on my raspberry pi. You can view my stats so far below. Not bad for a little over a week!\nYou can certainly look forward to hearing more about my adventures in SDR, I’m planning on becoming a HAM, as well as tracking some satellites and pulling data from them. In fact, I just pulled my first decent weather image today off of NOAA 18. Until next time!\nEdit: I’ve since moved the antenna outside to my wife’s planter. I’m hoping it stays stable and will keep an eye on it. I’m also wondering how long it will be before my apartment manager contacts us to take it down, even though it’s not attached to anything…\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/posts/tracking-planes/","section":"posts","tags":["RTL-SDR","Planes"],"title":"Tracking Planes"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/christmas/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Christmas"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/categories/christmas/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Christmas"},{"body":"Merry Christmas\nI hope you have a Merry Christmas 🎄 and a Happy New Year wherever you are reading this.

What? But, I thought this dream was over? Alas my good reader, it’s not. Thanks to the people at the Chorus NZ twitter account, I’ve been given some hope. A beam of light in the darkness.\nThis is the email I received:\nHi Dustin,\nI am from UCG – We are the service partner for Chorus – the provider of Ultra-Fast Broadband infrastructure as part of national fibre deployment initiated by the government.\nWe have received an Ultra-fast Broadband Connection request for {my_address}\nWe are now ready for to organise a site assessment. (How the contractor intends to bring fibre into the property/ site)\nWe have Scheduled assessment for Wednesday 16th May 2018 @ 9AM (I have also put it in the contractors calendar for now – so that the earliest available slot doesn’t get taken)\nPlease reply to confirm, the schedule.\nTo get ready for the construction of your requested service UCG will arrange for a technician to visit the site to investigate fibre access;\nAt the site assessment it is required that a representative of the owner(s) is available to discuss pathways and recommended routes.\nWe will need to gain access to the entire property, the communication panel/room and the basement (if applicable).\nThis person must be able to approve design options such as:\n• Location of distribution points (BUDIS)\n• Location and use of capping, trunking, access hatches or other visible equipment\n• Any underground or external civil works.\nWherever possible the design will use existing ducts and hidden pathways to remain out of sight to minimise visual impact.\u0026gt;\nAfter everything I’ve been through, I was a bit skeptical, but hopeful. Could this be true? It sounded almost too good to be true. I replied right away to let them know I would be available and waiting for the technician. A little bit of back and forth to answer their questions, and I was confirmed for the technician visit\nThe Visit I waited anxiously for the technician to arrive, and recieved a call stating he was in front of my building, promptly at 9 AM on the scoping date. I ran to my balcony, hoping to see him, but my hopes were quickly dashed. He wasn’t there… Was this a sign of how things were going to pan out? I certainly hoped not. I gave him directions and met him at the top of my driveway. He was extremely nice, and ready to get started with the scoping.\nI explained to him that I had a previous “scoping” visit, and it hadn’t gone so well. Up to this point, I’d been told there was no fibre to the building, they didn’t have scoping done, consent was needed, and a few other things. I had given up hope, and figured I would work through the process at a later date once they had done some more installs in my building. The technician was very apologetic, and stated it sounded like the previous tech (I believe at another contracting company) hadn’t done his job properly.\nI showed Fred (current contractor), the interior, and where I would like the interior point to be completed. He took photos of my hallway, as there is existing conduit there, and it was a possible connection point. We then went around the outside of my building, where he located the fibre drops for all of the buildings. That’s right, no matter what I was told, and the previous contractor had informed Chorus, there were in fact fibre drops at each building. It’s already been run behind the buildings, and 4 points for each building (which houses 4 apartments per building) were already put in place.\nSeriously, this was already a much more pleasant experience than the previous contractor.\nI walked around with Fred and asked questions relating to the installation, and showed him how our apartment is laid out. He answered all of my questions quickly and professsionally. He was much nicer overall than the previous person as well. In the end, he took measurements and photos, which will be used for scoping (this is much more than the previous tech). I informed him we have access to the ceiling through our apartment, which means they won’t need to put holes in the exterior wall (bonus!), and will make it an easier installation.\nAt this point, I just have to wait for the scoping to be approved by Chorus first, then given to me to give my apartment manager. I’m extra hopeful at this point. I replied to the person that set up the scheduling, and let them know how great of a job Fred did, and how pleasant it was to work with him. They will be with me for the entire installation process and keeping an eye on it. I also replied to Spark on twitter (through DM) to thank them as well.\nHopefully the proccess is much smoother from here on out. Even after switching to a new provider in the middle, it should be a smooth ride. We’ll see, and I’ll definitely keep updating here.\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/posts/a-ray-of-hope/","section":"posts","tags":["Fibre","Internet"],"title":"A Ray of Hope"},{"body":"This is it, the end. It’s all over, nothing more to say about it. The dream has ended. After dealing with this abysmal process for a month, I’ve given up. Being told time and again, that this is an “easy process” and everything will be smooth, I’m now told by BigPipe they don’t have any updates. That’s fine, I’m over.\nBut what’s this? A new email from BigPipe! Maybe it’s good news! Let’s have a read:\nHi ,\nThanks for taking part in our IPv6 trial that we announced on Geekzone. We’ve had a heap of really useful feedback to keep in mind for our future developments in this space.\nFrom the 12th of June 2018 the trial will be ending and you may notice a short 5-10 minute outage while we withdraw it. We’ll be making the change overnight at a time that has as little impact as possible. There’s nothing further you need to do, however as with any outage if you find you haven’t automatically connected again, simply restart your modem or router.\nIf you have any questions or want to chat this through, you can get in touch via https://ww.bigpipe.co.nz/contact-us\nThanks again for getting involved. The Bigpipe People\nOh, well, I guess it’s not a good update. So not only are they not able to install fibre, they are now actually removing services from their existing installs! I hadn’t looked at a new provider in years, as I’d been pretty happy with BigPipe up until recently. It was time to look for something new, but first, it’s time to post this email to GeekZone.\nOh, it looks like someone beat me to it! They are not only removing IPV6, they are also removing IPOE from customers that were set up that way. And that’s not even the best part. They have responded to pretty much every criticism with “It’s on the roadmap, but I can’t talk about that”. Here’s a piece of free advice BigPipe: Telling your customers that something is on some super secret roadmap that you can’t tell them about, is not the way to handle things like this.\nMoving On So I started looking for other providers. I have heard good things about two of them, 2Degrees and Voyager. I already use 2Degrees for my cell phone, so I figured I’d check them out first. I went to their website, and entered my address. Unfortunately it wasn’t found. So I decided to head to their nearest store to ask for help. Unfortuately, they told me in store they couldn’t help me either. No biggie.\nSo off to Voyager I go. I check out their prices, and it was actualy $5/month cheaper! Oh and the static IP was a one off cost of $15! This is versus the $45 I paid BigPipe for a public IP (not even static, that’s just public). Amazing. So I decided to order Voyager. They will be hooking my service up in 3 days (no fibre, thanks Chorus and BigPipe!), so I’ll be sure to update at that point. Oh, and they support IPV6! Amazing.\n#ByeBigpipe So after signing up, and receiving not only my static IP address, my IPV6 address pool, and the install date it was time to let BigPipe know I was leaving them after years of using their service. I replied to their most recent email on my connection (the one I received that morning stating they didn’t have any updates) to let them know I was going to be moving on. I received the most passive aggressive email I’ve ever gotten. Mind you, this was after a month of dealing with this process.\nI noted it as one of the reasons for my leaving BigPipe. You can’t continue to treat your customers like crap, not update them, leave them hanging, remove services, be the most expensive, and think you are going to keep them.\nBigpipe survey\nYep, it’s totally a moot point now Felix. I’ve moved on, and suggest anyone else with BigPipe do the same. Shame that meer hours earlier, you told me there was no update. It’s shocking how fast an update shows up when you tell them you are through with their shit.\nSo, for now, the fibre dream is over. I’ll wait a few more months before seeing how good Voyager is, and then possibly try again. Hopefully they’ll be able to handle the process better.\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/posts/fibre-nz-the-post-mortem/","section":"posts","tags":["Fibre","Internet"],"title":"Fibre NZ the Post Mortem"},{"body":"I’ve been living here in New Zealand for about 7 years now. In that time I’ve found a lot to love, and some to hate. Unfortunately, this story is about something that’s turned into a hate. Welcome to Fibre NZ: A Horror Story (in X parts since it’s ongoing).\nOne of the things I’ve been most excited about since moving to New Zealand, is their truly world class broadband. Most places in New Zealand, at least the most populated places, you are able to get Fibre to the Home (or FTTH). This is much different than the Fibre to the Node implimentation in places like Australia. A short commercial for Chorus and their FTTH spiel is below.\nYou can imagine, being the absolute geek that I am, I’ve been very excited about this. The ability to get Gigabit connections, to your house, is amazing. Simply mind blowing. To put this in a little bit of perspective, the average download speed in America is currently 18.7 megabits per second{:target=”_blank”}. That means it would take approximately 34 minutes to download an average 4 Gigabyte movie. That same movie, would take 42 Seconds to download at 800 megabits/second (averaging overhead on a gigabit connection).\nYou can now probably see why this is such an exciting prospect, especially for someone that consumes literally all of their entertainment online. No more buffering, no more worrying about downloading something while trying to stream, just pure, amazing, speed.\nAs you can see in the video above, it’s super easy to get installed right? Well… No… There are a few steps that need to (understandably) be completed first. A tech will need to come out and visit your location, see what the best route to run the cables are, and provide a plan that you (or your body corp if in a mutli-dwelling unit aka apartment) need to sign off on.\nThis is billed as a pretty easy process, and a quick one at that. They come out, they see what (if anything) is already run/installed, and plan it out, then give you a date for them to actually come do the installation. It sounds quite quick and easy, and it really seemed like it would be… at first…\nScoping I contacted my ISP BigPipe and asked them to update my connection from VDSL to Fibre. They are of course very excited to this, as it’s a much more reliable connection, meaning fewer issues for them. They replied quickly, and gave me a scoping date, which would be when the tech would come out and plan the install. I was quite excited as you can imagine. In fact, it was just a short time from the time I asked them to do the upgrade.\nThe install date came, and the tech called me early in the morning to make sure I would be home for the scoping that afternoon. Of course I would be! How could I not be! That afternoon the tech came out, and said he was here for the scoping. He asked where we would like the ONT (the inside portion of the fibre install), and I showed him. No problem he said, I’ll just check the lines outside, we’ve done quite a few installs at this location (it’s a set of apartments).\nGreat news! He came back in and stated he found everything easily outside, and that it would be a “very easy install” as most of the work was already done (I should have known then…), and it would be done two weeks from that date. I was extremely excited to say the least. I could hardly sleep during those two weeks.\nInstall Day Finally the install date came. I woke up at 5 AM, only because I was so excited, I was like a kid on christmas. I sat at home with my phone on me, waiting for the call. The tech was supposed to show up “Between 1 PM and 5 PM”. No problem. 11 am, no call (for scope day they had called by this time), no big deal. 11:45, still no call, starting to freak out just a tiny bit. 12:15, still no call. This is strange I think. I decided to look into it to make sure this is normal. It wasn’t.\nI made a post on Geek Zone NZ{:target=”_blank”} to ask if this is normal. I didn’t get a response within 30 seconds, so I did what a normal rational person would do. I freaked out and pinged BigPipe and Chorus on twitter. BigPipe responed very quickly, asking for my email so they could check things. No problem I thought, gave them my email address. Great news! They stated they had checked my install, and there was no problem, the tech “would call a half hour before he showed up”. How relaxing that was to know things were just fine (spoiler: they weren’t).\nA few minutes after I got a response from BigPipe, I received a message from Chorus, asking for my address so they could make sure things were good, because it was unusual for the tech to have no called in the morning. A sense of dread overwhelmed me. I gave Chorus my address and waited.\nAbout 10 minutes after I had sent them my address, my phone dinged. It was a private message on Twitter from Chorus.\nWe can confirm that your broadband provider was updated on 24/04 advising that consents would be required before we could move forward with the connection. Unfortunately, this means that the install will not go ahead today.\nThe 24th was two days prior. So my ISP (BigPipe) was informed two days before the install date, that it wouldn’t be happening. So for two days, my ISP neglected to tell me, that there was an issue with the install, and it wouldn’t be happening. Not only that, they mentioned it was a “consent” issue. Consenting however, had been completed when the first people in my complex had fibre installed. It came from the body corp and was completed for all of the buildings at once. We even confirmed this with the owners below us.\nI went back and forth with BigPipe over what consent was missing (they weren’t sure), how to get it (no idea) and what I should do now (just wait, it will take at least 30 more days)… That’s right, 30 more days for… something… to happen. It wasn’t until last night (6 days after the install date), that they told me it was actually an issue with the fibre cable not actually having been run to my building. Even though the apartment directly below us has fibre installed.\nThey told me they can’t do anything until Chorus does, can’t tell me how long it’s going to take, or when Chorus will be out to do another scope… for fibre that’s already run to the building… which has been confirmed by the first chorus tech… At this point, I’m ready to just give up. When (IF and it’s a big IF) I hear anything back, I’ll be sure to update, until then, I’ll just wait for the fibre install that isn’t…\nUpdate 1: 30-04-18 4:23 PM I just received the following email from BigPipe:\nHi\nChorus now tells us that “no consents have been gained for this property” and they need to assess and seek consent before they can proceed.\nYou’ve told us before that some of your neighbours have been using fibre already, and we’ve checked all ## apartments in number # and we can confirm that 4 of your neighbours have fibre installed. We’ve told Chorus this and requested them to recheck and will update you.\nIt seems like Chorus is really dropping the ball on this entire thing. More updates to come I’m sure… Stay tuned!\nUpdate 2: 01-05-18 11:50 AM I just received a follow up email from Bigpipe:\nHi,\nWe heard back from Chorus and they said they hope to get us an update this week. We will keep you updated and informed on the progress. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work this through\nHopefully this means it’s getting closer, I won’t hold my breath though.\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/posts/fibre-nz-a-horror-story/","section":"posts","tags":["Fibre","Internet"],"title":"Fibre NZ a Horror Story"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/tags/family/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Family"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/categories/family/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Family"},{"body":"Like a sucker punch out of left field Something has been bothering me a lot lately.

It really bugged me that I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. Anyone that knows me, knows I’m not one to talk about my feelings at all, good or bad. It just isn’t me, which is totally fine, seriously! I’m an introvert when it comes to myself, that’s just how it is.\nThat also makes this hard to write, but screw it, I need to get it out. Don’t worry, I have plenty of people I could easily talk to about it. I have a very loving and understanding wife (seriously, she’s the best person I’ve ever met, she’s amazing and the reason I smile most of the time!), I have any number of friends and family I could call. However, there are times when you just want to write something and not actually talk to someone. It’s just how I deal with things a lot of the time.\nIt wasn’t until I was driving home from doing the grocery shopping today, that I realized what was bothering me so badly. And when I did realize it, it was like a punch to the gut. One so hard I am not afraid to admit, I nearly had to pull over. What possibly could give me such a reaction? Well, a CD (yes they still exist). I was pretty bored with the radio, and decided to flip on a CD instead of trying to fiddle with my phone while driving, because I’m smart like that.\nThe moment the first lyrics came through the speakers, I lost it:\nIs the weight of the world on my shoulders?\nThose lyrics hit me like a ton of bricks, but not because the weight of the world is on my shoulders, but because of my sister. I’ve been thinking about her a lot. I do often. There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think about her, and miss her more than words can describe. But lately, it’s been worse. I couldn’t quite figure out why. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t need an excuse to miss my sister. I never will and I will never apologize for missing her.\nWhy would those lyrics hit me like a ton of bricks and bring her to the forefront of my mind? Well, it’s not the lyrics, its’ the music. It’s the album. Leave A Whisper by Shinedown was one of her favorite albums. It’s been in my CD player in my car for who knows how long. I just tend to not listen to it often, because it makes me miss her so very much. I remember all those times driving along, both of us singing at the top of our lungs to the CD. I remember all those times rocking out with my sister. I can almost look over and see her there, singing along with the songs with me, and it hurts. Bad.\nIn a few short weeks, I’ll be the same age my sister was when she passed away 3 years ago. And I realized, that’s what’s been bothering me so much lately. We are all three years apart, my sister, my brother and myself. But after this year, I’ll have out lived her. She was always so strong, always the rock I knew would always be there, and now, she’s gone. Not one day goes by that I don’t think about her. Not one day that I don’t wish I could give her a call, just to say hi.\nHeck, I even miss her kicking my ass sometimes. Even when she’d grab the muscle below your jaw while you were driving (I’ve nearly crashed more than once due to her doing that!), or her scaring the daylights out of you because it amused her so much.\nI guess sometimes I really do have the weight of the world on my shoulders. But I know that she’s up there someplace, looking down on me helping me in some way, to carry those burdens. I know that she wouldn’t want me to be sad. In fact, she’d probably pick on me for it, in the ways only she could. So I’ll lift my head, remember the side of her that few of us got to see, and keep moving along.\nI’ll mourn in the way only a brother can, and know that she loved me just as much as I loved her. Even if she had strange ways of showing it sometimes. And I’ll keep listening to that CD, and think of her every time I hear it. And I’ll smile, because I know she’s no longer in pain, and that I’ll get to see her again someday. I look forward to it, and I know she does too. And I know she wouldn’t want us sad. She would want us to remember her with a smile, so that’s what I’ll do.\nAfter all, troubles will come, and they will pass.\n","link":"http://localhost:1313/posts/like-a-sucker-punch-out-of-left-field/","section":"posts","tags":["Trish","Family"],"title":"Like a Sucker Punch out of Left Field"},{"body":"","link":"http://localhost:1313/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"}]
